## Installing

### Prerequisites

To run roBrowser you will need a browser that supports [WebGL](http://www.chromeexperiments.com/webgl/) and is OpenGL ES 2.0 compatible. We've tested the following browsers:

* Chrome
* FireFox
* Opera
* IE11

If you don't run roBrowser in a Chrome App, you will need a Java plugin installed instead.

### Quickstart

1.  [Download roBrowser](https://github.com/vthibault/roBrowser/archive/master.zip) and extract it.
2.  [Convert DB](https://github.com/vthibault/roBrowser/tree/master/tools/converter/) to get custom content to roBrowser.
3.  [Compile scripts](https://github.com/vthibault/roBrowser/tree/master/tools/build/) to reduce loading time.
4.  Install the [remote client](https://github.com/vthibault/roBrowser/tree/master/client) and set the parameter *remoteClient* to your server.
5.  Install the [websocket proxy](https://github.com/herenow/wsProxy/blob/master/README.md) and set the parameter *socketProxy* to your proxy server URL.
6.  Configure roBrowser - [documentation](http://www.robrowser.com/getting-started#API) and some [examples](https://github.com/vthibault/roBrowser/tree/master/examples).
